        <p>"Dear Carol, Thank you so much! From start to finish you have been the most incredible real estate broker we have ever experienced in our more than dozen moves. Not only did the sale itself exceed our hopes, but working with you was stress free and delightful!"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Carol recently helped my wife and me to purchase a condominium unit in Cambridge. We found her to be extremely helpful in lots of ways: she displayed an impressive knowledge of the market and of how this unit fit in (overpriced); she made constructive suggestions about what to say and not to say in the Offer, resulting in our acquiring the unit well below the asking price; and she responded promptly and effectively to our requests for information and for other kinds of assistance. All this with good humor and a positive attitude. And most importantly, she always laughed at my jokes.”<br><br></p>

        <p>"We loved working with Rachel. She completely customizes the process for each client, and shapes her level of involvement based on your needs. Without any prompting, she quickly figured out when to give us space so we could discuss things on our own, and when to step in and provide guidance. She was responsive and made herself available whenever we needed her. Rachel is patient, considerate, flexible, and stuck with us, even when we pulled an offer letter at the 11th hour. She is a great resource – she knows the business incredibly well and has a whole stable of contacts for inspections, mortgages, legal advice. She was very respectful of our budget; she never pushed us to look at more expensive houses, and helped us slow down and be more mindful when it felt like our budget was spiraling higher than we were comfortable with. Rachel is transparent and honest, so we really trusted that she was guiding us in the right direction every step of the way. Buying a house isn't an easy process, so it makes a huge difference to have someone you can rely on and who really listens to your goals, deal-breakers, and budget. We've been in our house for eight months now and are so happy with how everything turned out. Work with Rachel, and you'll set yourself up for success – you'll have a reliable partner throughout the process, and she'll get you through it successfully with her great energy, honesty, and expertise."</p>

        <p>"We first met Carol when she was the listing broker for a house on Fresh Pond Parkway that we were interested in buying. She was very straightforward and honest when discussing what it would be like if we lived there and it helped us make an informed decision to buy that house. When we decided to move closer to Harvard Square, we worked with Carol to sell that house and buy a townhouse. Recently, when we sold the townhouse, Carol really out did herself. She convinced us to stage the empty townhouse even though we didn't want to bother doing that. In hindsight, it seems that her marketing plan was perfect and that it is why we received multiple offers and were able to sell for more than our listing price. If you are looking for a broker that knows Cambridge like the back of her hand and that will work hard for you and treat you fairly, then look no further."</p>

        <p>"I chose Carol over three other agent candidates because I believed she had my best interests in mind. Her proposal was the most applicable to my situation. She timed the listing based on my schedule, and stayed away from elaborate selling schemes. Carol kept an inherently stressful undertaking positive, cheerful, even fun. Always supportive, always professional, always available, she was hard-working and kept me informed at every step. She gently guided me through decisions after serious thought and consultation. Her experience and professionalism was comforting. I recommend her without reservation."</p>

        <p>“Carol and her team were completely professional but also caring and kind. Carol knows the market thoroughly; she was the selling agent when we bought, and our listing agent when we sold, and we could not be happier with how the whole process went on both ends.”</p>

        <p>“I was recently a first time buyer in a seller's market. Rachel was extremely helpful in both introducing me to the entire process, and finding homes that looked like good fits. With so many homes going for far over asking price, this included giving her opinion on which homes were more worth making offers on, and which were likely to end up out of my price range. After a month or two of looking, I ended up getting my offer accepted on a great place, where I'm happy I'm still at today.”</p>

        <p>"My sisters and I hired Carol to assist us with the sale of our large, family home in Cambridge. From the outset, we were impressed with her energy, organization, and professionalism. Despite the fact that selling the house, which had been in our family for 60 years, seemed like a daunting project, Carol made the house sale feel manageable. She provided expert help and support at each step in the process, and always did so in an upbeat and friendly manner. I never felt that she were too busy to make our questions or concerns a priority. She offered sound advice about how to present the house in the best possible way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She also went out of her way to be helpful, such as offering to meet with and supervise workmen involved in preparing the house for sale and staging the house herself. We were delighted with the outcome of our house sale, which sold quickly and for well above the asking price, largely due to Carol’s ingenious marketing strategy. Carol is dynamic, highly efficient realtor and I would recommend her without hesitation to anyone looking to buy or sell property."</p>

        <p>"I&nbsp;just wanted to thank you again for ushering us through this entire process. We love our new home--every inch of it fits what we wanted. The dream I thought would never come true… you tolerated our quirks, saw us through some disappointments, never gave up on finding something that worked. You always found ways to put us all at ease… and while I won't miss the roller coaster, I will miss having you in our lives on an almost daily(!) basis. You are such a lovely person with an enormous heart. And you just happen to rock at what you do. Thank you so much for everything."</p>
